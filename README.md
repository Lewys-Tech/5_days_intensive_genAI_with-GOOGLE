# 🚀 Exploring Generative AI with Google's Gemini API

Welcome to my GitHub project! This repository showcases my work from the **5-Day Intensive Generative AI Course with Google**. The first session focused on **prompting using the Gemini API key**, and this project captures the hands-on skills I gained in crafting prompts to generate creative content. Whether you're a beginner or an AI enthusiast, I hope this inspires you to dive into the world of generative AI! 🌟

## 🌟 What is This Project About?

This project is part of a **5-day intensive course by Google**, designed to teach practical applications of generative AI. The first session introduced **prompting**—the art of designing inputs to interact with the Gemini API and produce text, images, or other outputs. Here, you'll find **code and examples** I built during that session, demonstrating how to harness the Gemini API for creative and useful results.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Gemini API**: The backbone of this project, enabling content generation from prompts.
- **Python**: The language used to write the scripts and connect to the API.

## 📋 Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have:

- A **Google account** to access **Google AI Studio**.
- An **API key** from Google AI Studio.
- **Python 3.10 or later** installed.
- Basic familiarity with Python.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up your API key:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. Add your API key like this:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Run the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 📝 What Does This Project Do?

This project uses the **Gemini API** to generate content based on prompts. Here are some examples of what it can do:

- **Text Generation**: Craft stories, poems, or answers to questions.
- **Image Generation**: Create visuals from descriptive text (if supported by the API version).
- **Creative Exploration**: Experiment with multimodal outputs combining text and images.
- **Fine Tuning a Custom model
- **Function calling with Google Gemini API Key

Enjoy experimenting with **Generative AI**! 🚀
